Easy GCP Compute Engine Instance Comparison

## Why? 

Because it's frustrating to compare instances using GCP's own machine type, pricing, and other pages.

## Who? 
It was started by [@powdahound](https://twitter.com/powdahound) who created the AWS version (ec2instances.info), 

rewritten to Google Cloud by Avi Keinan from DoIT International, and awaits your improvements on GitHub.

## How? 
Data is scraped from multiple pages on the GCP site.
